					h1 Burlingables
					p Burlingables is a wonderful tree-lined neighborhood bursting with architectural delights. Just steps from Burlingame High School and all of its modern athletic facilities, including tennis courts and the largest public swimming pool between San Francisco and Santa Clara. The neighborhood is arguably Burlingame’s most walkable neighborhood too; it is very close to Burlingame Avenue’s shops and restaurants, and also near the Downtown Burlingame Caltrain station..

					h3 History
					p Residents here would do well to look for horseshoes in their gardens! The famous San Mateo Stock Farm, a horse breeding ranch owned by William Corbitt, operated during the late 1800s on the present grounds of Burlingame High School. Around the turn of the twentieth century, Francis Carolan, who lent his name to the street in front of the high school, and his railroad car heiress wife, Harriett Pullman Carolan, bought Corbitt’s horse ranch and used the former racetrack for polo matches. Bloomfield Road includes a couple model homes built for the 1939 Treasure Island Worlds’ Fair. The homes were shipped to Bloomfield Road by barge after the fair ended. Today, the area is known for its quaint, tree-lined streets, and its proximity to Burlingame Avenue, Washington Park, Burlingame High School and the city’s recreation center.
